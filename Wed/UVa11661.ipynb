    "Everybody knows that along the more important highways there are countless fast food restaurants. One can find easily hamburgers, hot dogs, pizzas, sandwiches ... food everywhere. Many times the problem isn’t to find a restaurant but a drugstore. After a big lunch with fast food it’s normal that we need a drugstore because our stomach begins to feel pain. Given the locations of the restaurants and drugstores on a highway, you want to determine the minimum distance between a restaurant and a drugstore.\n",

    "The first line of each test case gives an integer L (1 ≤ L ≤ 2000000) indicating the length of the highway. The second line of each test case contains a string S of length L, showing the positions of the restaurants and drugstores along the highway in the following manner: \n",

    "• The character ‘R’ represents a place with a restaurant. \n",

    "• The character ‘.’ represents an empty place. \n",
